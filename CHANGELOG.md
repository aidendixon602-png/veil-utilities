# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-24

First stable release. 386 commands across 22 modules.

### Added

- **Zero-setup AI** — `AI_API_KEY` auto-detects Groq, Gemini, OpenRouter and OpenAI keys and
  picks the provider and free model automatically. With no key at all, `ask`/`summarize` fall back
  to a free no-signup provider, and `ocr` uses the shared OCR.space demo key.
- **Zero-setup music** — five free public Lavalink 4.2+ nodes with health checks, a connection
  watchdog and automatic failover. Set `LAVALINK_URI` to bring your own, or `MUSIC_ENABLED=false`
  to turn music off.
- **Spotify fallback** — `,sp` search works with no Spotify app via Deezer data.
- Full bug audit across every module: giveaway validation, ticket dedupe, reminder caps
  (25 per user), level XP caps, VoiceMaster bitrate limits, loop isolation so one failing
  background task can't take others down.

### Fixed

- Bot-only destructive actions (timeouts, unbans) are now counted by antinuke.
- Startup no longer depends on python-dotenv and gives a clear missing-package message.
- Run from any directory — the database and log paths no longer depend on the working directory.
- Feeds survive per-post failures instead of dying on the first bad item.

### Security

- SSRF-safe HTTP helper (`core/net.py`) blocks private and link-local addresses for every
  user-supplied URL; DNS rebinding is caught via a resolver trace hook.
- Downloads are size-capped (`read_capped`) everywhere media is fetched.
- Fake permissions can no longer be granted to `@everyone`, and `uperm` ranks are enforced.
